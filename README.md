# Strawberry JAM !! 

Hey ! This is the repository of a little program I made with some friends from my School during a JAM.
The goal was to code anything we want in a given theme : Infinity.

So we made our own little reproduction of the videogame [*Mini Metro*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Metro) 
Its still in a very very very basic state, we didnt aim to make a perfect game or even a pretty game, this was mostly 
a way of introducing to our fellows friends from 1st year the beautiful and incredible world of C++ & SFML :D

Maybe I'll come back on it and improve it, maybe not who knows ?
